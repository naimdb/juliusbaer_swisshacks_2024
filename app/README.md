## Overview
This project is an audio deepfake detection system developed for the Julius Baer SwissHacks 2024 event. The system addresses three main tasks:

1. **Deepfake Detection**: Identifying audio generated by AI (deepfake audio).
2. **Impersonation Detection**: Identifying human voices attempting to impersonate others.
3. **Information Verification**: Verifying the information provided by the client against existing records.

## Features
### Deepfake Detection
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracts multiple features from audio recordings.
- **Pattern Learning**: Learns patterns from deepfake audio to identify potential fakes.

### Impersonation Detection
- **Voice Blueprint Learning**: Uses Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) trained on OpenAI Whisper encoder embeddings to learn voice "blueprints" from a sample of true voices.
- **Likelihood Computation**: Computes the likelihood of a potential impersonator's voice being generated from a specific person's "blueprint."

### Information Verification
- **Fact Checking**: Utilizes an on-premise LLaMA2 8 billion parameter model to verify information provided by the client against known data.
- **Audio-to-Text Translation**: Uses Whisper Large V3, an open-source model, to convert audio to text for further processing.

## Setup Instructions
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Conda Environment**:
   ```
   conda create -n app python=3.11
   conda activate app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Optionally, for faster execution, consider using the `--user` flag or `mamba` as a faster alternative to `conda`.

3. **Deepfake Detection Module**:
   - **Training the Model**:
     ```
     python src/fake/train_fake.py
     ```
   - **Running Prediction on New Audio Clips**:
     ```
     python src/fake/predict.py ../audio_clips
     ```

4. **Impersonation Detection Module**:
   - **Train and Evaluate Models**:
     Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:
     ```
     jupyter notebook src/impersonator/train_evaluate.ipynb
     ```

5. **Information Verification Module**:
   - **Match Audio to Person**:
     ```
     python src/message.py
     ```

6. **Web Application**:
   - **Launch the Application**:
     ```
     python app.py
     ```

## Usage Instructions
For each module, detailed usage instructions are provided within their respective scripts and Jupyter notebook. Ensure to follow the sequence of training before prediction to maximize the effectiveness of the models.

## System Requirements
- Python 3.11
- Conda environment
